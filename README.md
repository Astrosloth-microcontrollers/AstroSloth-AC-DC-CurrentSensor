# AstroSloth-AC-DC-CurrentSensor
The AstroSloth Reflow AC/DC Current Sensing Module is a small hall effect sensor that can sense AC or DC current up to +/- 20 A. Using the bidirectional Broadcom ACHS-7122, the current can be tracked as a linear analog output voltage, which is centered around 2.5V, with a sensitivity that changes every 100mV/A.
